# First steps

Chess maker isn't designed around any specific chess rule or piece.
This means any variant you make is a first-class citizen and should work
just as fine as the standard game.

This section covers the base concepts you'll have to learn in order to create these
variants.

However - you will probably not need to know all concepts in order to create a simple rule.
It's recommended to skim through the concepts section, and then head to the tutorial that
interests you.
