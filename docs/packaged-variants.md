| Chess960                  | Chess960, as described [here](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960#Setup).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Knooks                    | Rooks and knights of the same player can be moved to the same position and merge into a Knook: a piece that moves both like a rook and a knight (but cannot castle).                                                                       |
| Forced En Passant         | En passant capture is mandatory if available. If a player is checked and can en passant, they lose. A player can move into a position that will put their king under attack if the next player must en passant instead of taking the king. |
| Knight Boosting           | When a pawn is promoted to a knight, the player gets an extra turn to move that knight.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Omnipotent F6 Pawn        | When there is an enemy piece on F6, a pawn can be summoned there.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Siberian Swipe            | When a Rook hasn't moved yet, it can jump over all pieces in a file to capture an enemy opponent's rook.                                                                                                                                   |
| Il Vaticano               | When 2 bishops of the same player have a 2-square gap between them, and that gap is filled by 2 enemy pieces, the bishops can switch places, capturing both enemy pieces.                                                                  |
| Beta Decay                | When a queen has an empty, straight, line of 3 or more squares with a board edge, hole, or a piece of the same player - it can split to a rook, bishop, and pawn - in that order.                                                          |
| La Bastarda               | When a queen is moved to an enemy king, the king can move away directly opposite from the queen, summoning a pawn of the same player as the queen between them.                                                                            |
| King Cant Move to C2      | Kings cannot move to C2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Vertical Castling         | Castlling can also be done vertically.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Double Check To Win       | In addition to checkmating, a player can win by giving check with 2 pieces or more.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Capture All Pieces To Win | Instead of checkmating, a player can win by capturing all pieces of the opponent. Kings can be under attack and can be taken.                                                                                                              |
